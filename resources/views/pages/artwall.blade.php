            <p class="mt-5">
                She graduated in Graphic Design from the Tehran University of Art in 1992.
                She is an international artist whose work has appeared in exhibitions in Iran and Italy, Germany, China,
                South Korea and the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                She has achieved many international awards on watercolour and acrylic painting. She achieved silver
                medal in China in 2005, followed by a gold medal in 2006 awarded by China Expo.  Ramezani founded Faam
                Gallery (previously Known as Fam Gallery - "fam" in the Persian Language means colour, form and shape).
                Ramezani, as the owner and art director of Faam Gallery has organised over 231 group and solo
                exhibitions covering a spectrum of visual arts. Faam Gallery has also held exhibitions in Italy,
                Germany, China, South Korea and the United Kingdom.

            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                One of the main aims of Faam Gallery is to promote Eastern art in all media by organising exhibitions
                and Expos around the world.
                Among notable festivals of Persian art organised by the Faam Gallery was the First Persian Contemporary
                Artists Movement.
                This festival forged a ground-breaking collaboration between artists and the private sector who came
                together to support the development
                of art in Persia and to honour Persian masters such as Master Mohammed Javadipur.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1 mb-3">
                Faam Gallery’s exceptional efforts to showcase Persian artists and their work earned the Gallery a
                silver medal in China in 2005,
                followed by a gold medal in 2006 awarded by China Expo. In 2007, at an exhibition in Seoul, Popular
                Persian Painters, Faam Gallery’s aims
                and achievements were officially recognised in the award of a Certificate for consistent effort in
                promoting Persian art to worldwide audiences.
                Faam Gallery has also worked to introduce Persian art and culture to younger audiences by holding
                exhibitions and festivals for children, and
                organising creative workshops on themes such as Persian Myths and Identity.
